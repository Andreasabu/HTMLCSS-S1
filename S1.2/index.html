          Roger Federer has bowed out of the Australian Open with a shock
          four-set loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Federer's chances of winning a
          third consecutive Australian Open title were ended as the 20-year-old
          came of age on Rod Laver Arena. The Greek, who was not born when
          Federer made his professional debut, has rapidly established himself
          as one of the most exciting up-and-coming talents in the game and
          backed it up spectacularly with a 6-7 (11) 7-6 (3) 7-5 7-6 (5) victory
          to move through to a first slam quarter-final. Federer had not lost a
          match at Melbourne Park since a semi-final defeat by Novak Djokovic in
          2016 but his often-brilliant forehand was wayward, especially at the
          big moments, and he failed to take four set points in the second set
          which might well have changed the outcome.

    <div>For the first time all evening, Tsitsipas looked overwhelmed as he stepped out for the on-court interview, saying: "I'm the happiest man on earth right now. I cannot describe it.

        "From the very beginning it was very important to keep that mindset, to believe in yourself, believe in your capabilities.</div>

          <p>"Roger is a legend of the sport, so much respect for him. He showed such good tennis over the years. I've been idolising him since the age of six.

            "It was a dream come true just being on Rod Laver facing him. Winning at the end, I cannot describe it."
            
            "I had an aggressive mindset from the start, stayed in the moment, got first serves in and tried to press. I didn't lose my patience and that was the key.
            
            "I showed fighting spirit and had most of the crowd supporting me. I haven't seen such a large crowd all my life. The atmosphere, the vibes and the energy shown to Roger and me today was indescribable."
